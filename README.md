# ArcCAM

  ArcCAM is a simple CAM plug-in for Moi3D written by Len Shelton of PROBOTIX.
  
	Moi3D (www.moi3d.com) offers the most powerful and user-friendly drawing tools available in any software today. The aim of this project is to develop a CAM plug-in for Moi3D that generates and exports tool paths for CNC machines. This CAM software will be designed to produce optimized gcode, leveraging the advanced gcode controls used by modern CNC machines.
  
	Features:
	- Identify semicircles and use G2 and G3 arcs whenever possible
	- Utilize the CNC controls built-in canned cycles (G8x), subroutines, and pocketing operations.
	- Integrate tool diameter compensation (G41 & G42)
